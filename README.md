### Project Overview
In the age of big data, supermarkets collect a massive amount of sales data daily. This project leverages the power of data analysis and visualization to gain valuable insights from a fictional supermarket's sales dataset. Using tools like Excel for data cleaning and transformation, and Power BI for analysis and visualization, we aim to uncover patterns, make data-driven decisions, and enhance business strategies.

### Limitations
I had to remove all zero from my total tax & cost of goods columns which could have affected my accuracy of my calculations, and also subtract 5% tax from the  total sales to get my total sales inclucluding tax. with all these i can say there is a correlation with the various data points in both the excel & Power BI dashboard.
